<b><h3>Exotic dance moves</h3></b>
Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br>
Polynesian chicken dance<br><p style="margin-left: 15px;">
A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around <br>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful"
</p><br>
Icelandic brownian shuffle<br><p style="margin-left: 15px;">
Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br>involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably
tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>modern styles such as Twerking.<br></p>
Arctic robot dance<br><p style="   margin-left: 15px;">
An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br>discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants
of Northern Alaska and Canada.</p><br>
For more of my research, see my <a href="#"> exotic dance research page.</a><br><br>
Yours sincerely,<br>
